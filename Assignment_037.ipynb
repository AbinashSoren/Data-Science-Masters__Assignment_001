    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into \n",

    "models. In data science, encoding is used to transform categorical \n",
    "data into numerical values, which can be used as input to machine \n",
    "learning models. Categorical data includes variables such as gender,\n",
    "color, and occupation, which are not numerical in nature but can be \n",
    "represented using numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding is useful in data science because machine learning models\n",
    "cannot directly process categorical data. By encoding the categorical \n",
    "data into numerical values, it becomes possible to use these variables\n",
    "as input features for the models. There are several different\n",
    "encoding techniques available, including one-hot encoding, label\n",
    "encoding, binary encoding, and ordinal encoding.\n",

    "Overall, data encoding is an important preprocessing step in data\n",
