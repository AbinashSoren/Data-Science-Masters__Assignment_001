    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are two different techniques \n",
    "used for converting categorical data into numerical data, but there \n",
    "is a subtle difference between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding is a technique of transforming categorical data into\n",
    "numerical data by assigning a unique numerical label to each category. \n",
    "For example, in a dataset of colors, we can assign \"red\" to label 0, \n",
    "\"blue\" to label 1, \"green\" to label 2, etc. This technique is commonly\n",
    "used for binary classification or models where the categories have a \n",
    "natural order or hierarchy, such as in the case of \"low,\" \"medium,\" \n",
    "and \"high.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is also used to transform categorical data into\n",
    "numerical data, but it involves assigning a numerical value to each \n",
    "category based on their rank or order. For example, in a dataset of \n",
    "educational degrees, we can assign \"Associate's\" to 1, \"Bachelor's\" \n",
    "to 2, \"Master's\" to 3, and \"Doctorate\" to 4. This technique is \n",
    "commonly used in models where the categories have an inherent order,\n",
    "but the magnitude or spacing between them is not known, such as in \n",
    "the case of \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" where the distance between \n",
    "\"low\" and \"medium\" may not be the same as the distance between \n",
    "\"medium\" and \"high.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Label Encoding is suitable for categorical data where \n",
    "there is no natural order or hierarchy, while Ordinal Encoding is \n",
    "useful for categorical data where there is an inherent order or \n",
    "hierarchy.\n",

    "variable, which can help improve the performance of a machine \n",
    "learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1_For each unique value of the categorical variable, calculate the\n",
    "mean of the target variable. This will give you an idea of how each \n",
    "value of the categorical variable relates to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2_Sort the unique values of the categorical variable based on their\n",
    "mean of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3_Assign an ordinal number to each unique value of the categorical \n",
    "variable based on its position in the sorted list.\n",
    "The value with the highest mean of the target variable gets the\n",
    "highest ordinal number, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4_Replace the categorical variable with its ordinal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of when you might use Target Guided Ordinal \n",
    "Encoding is in a project to predict customer churn. \n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset with a categorical variable called \"plan\" \n",
    "that represents the type of phone plan that each customer \n",
    "has (e.g., basic, standard, premium). \n",
    "You suspect that the type of phone plan is related to customer churn,\n",

    "# Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of how two variables change or vary together.\n",

    "Covariance is an essential concept in statistical analysis because \n",
    "it helps us understand the relationship between two variables. \n",
    "If two variables have a positive covariance, \n",
    "it means that they tend to increase or decrease together.\n",
    "If they have a negative covariance, it means that they tend to move\n",

    "If the covariance is zero, it means that there is no linear \n",

    "\n",
    "Covariance can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X,Y) = Î£[(Xi - Xmean) * (Yi - Ymean)] / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X and Y are the two variables, Xi and Yi are the individual\n",
