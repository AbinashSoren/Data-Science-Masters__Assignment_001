    "most important thing to remember to understand PDFs is that the \n",

    "# Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",

    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable and F(x) is the probability that X is less than or equal to x.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF can be used for both discrete and continuous random variables. For discrete random variables, the CDF is a step function that increases by the probability mass at each possible value of X. For continuous random variables, the CDF is a continuous function that increases monotonically from 0 to 1 over the range of possible values of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following PMF for rolling a fair six-sided die:\n",
    "\n",

    "F(x)\t0\t1/6\t2/6\t3/6\t4/6\t5/6\t 1\t1\n",
    "This CDF indicates that the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 3/6 = 1/2, since F(3) = 3/6. Similarly, the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 5 is 5/6, since F(5) = 5/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is useful for many applications in probability and statistics. For example, the CDF can be used to calculate the probability of observing a value of X within a certain range, by taking the difference between the CDF values at the upper and lower bounds of the range. The CDF can also be used to generate random numbers from a given probability distribution, by sampling uniformly from the range [0, 1] and finding the value of X that corresponds to the CDF value closest to the sampled value.\n",
