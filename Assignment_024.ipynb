Unlike (total) range, the interquartile range is a more commonly used statistic, since it excludes the lower 25% and upper 25%, therefore reflecting more accurately valid values and excluding the outliers.\n",
    "Range: it is the length of the smallest interval which contains all the data and is calculated by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum) and provides an indication of statistical dispersion[4]. It bears the same units as the data used for calculating it.
