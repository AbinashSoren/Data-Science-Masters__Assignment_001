    "Data augmentation is a technique used in machine learning to \n",

    "SMOTE, which stands for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique,\n",
    "is a popular data augmentation technique used in the context of\n",

    "minority class by interpolating between existing examples. \n",
    "Specifically, for each minority class example, SMOTE identifies \n",
